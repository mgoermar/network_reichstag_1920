# network_reichstag_1920
A simple visualization of the network of the women representatives in the first Reichtag of the Weimar Republic (1920-24) and the topics they were working on. As source material the digitized protocols of the Reichstag (https://www.reichstagsprotokolle.de/index.html) were used.
The visualization was realized using Gephi (www.gephi.org) with the SigmaExporter plugin developed by the Oxford Internet Institute.
