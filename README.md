# network_reichstag_1920
A simple visualization of the network of the women representatives in the first Reichtag of the Weimar Republic (1920-24) and the topics they were working on. As source material the digitized protocols of the Reichstag (https://www.reichstagsprotokolle.de/index.html) were used. For a more detailed discussion of the data and visualization presented here see https://doinghistory.hypotheses.org/.
The visualization was realized using Gephi (www.gephi.org) with the SigmaExporter plugin (https://github.com/oxfordinternetinstitute/gephi-plugins/tree/sigmaexporter-plugin) developed by the Oxford Internet Institute.
